Koa and MongoDB RESTful API boostrapping library

**THIS DOES NOT WORK YET**

I am still porting the actions from my old sequalize setup.
I will finish this prototype in the next few days.

Returns a Koa instance configured to serve a RESTful API with the configured MongoDB and collections.
Comes with Cors and  gzip compression by default.
